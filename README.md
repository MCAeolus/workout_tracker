To anyone reading this: the entire interface (and also most all docs you see here) were generated by Claude in the browser. I went through and fixed problems afterwards (ex. missing 'finish workout' button, and Google oAuth issues). It is severely in need of being cleaned up, and I am going to add some features on to this for more support in the future.
You would have to setup your own oAuth/client ID in google developer cloud as well as the google sheet for "DB" access. I really just meant for this to be free, painless to use, and easy to sync between devices.

# Workout Tracker

A free, self-hosted workout tracking web app that uses Google Sheets as a database. Perfect for tracking your lifts at the gym on your phone, with full access on desktop for planning and reviewing progress.

## Features

✅ **Fixed Routine Support** - Create workout splits (Push/Pull/Legs, etc.)  
✅ **Quick Logging** - Minimal taps to log weight, reps, and notes  
✅ **Rest Timer** - Automatic rest timer after completing sets  
✅ **Previous Performance** - See your last workout's numbers for progressive overload  
✅ **Exercise Notes** - Track form cues, fatigue levels, and other observations  
✅ **Mobile-First Design** - Optimized for gym use on your phone  
✅ **100% Free** - Hosted on GitHub Pages, data in your own Google Sheet  
✅ **Your Data** - Everything stays in your Google account  

## Quick Start

### 1. Set Up Google Sheet
Create a Google Sheet with two sheets:
- **Routines**: `RoutineName`, `ExerciseName`, `Notes`, `DefaultSets`
- **WorkoutLog**: `Date`, `Routine`, `Exercise`, `SetNumber`, `Weight`, `Reps`, `Notes`

### 2. Enable Google Sheets API & Create OAuth Credentials
- Create a project in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- Enable Google Sheets API
- Configure OAuth consent screen (add yourself as test user)
- Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Web application type)
- Add your GitHub Pages URL to Authorized JavaScript origins

### 3. Deploy to GitHub Pages
- Fork this repo (or create new repo with the files)
- Enable GitHub Pages in Settings
- Access at `https://[username].github.io/workout-tracker/`

### 4. Configure & Sign In
- Open the deployed site
- Enter your OAuth Client ID and Spreadsheet ID
- Sign in with your Google account
- Authorize the app to access your spreadsheet
- Start tracking!

📖 **Full setup guide:** See [SETUP_GUIDE.md](SETUP_GUIDE.md)

## How It Works

- Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no API server needed)
- OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication
- Data stored in your own Google Sheet
- API calls made directly from browser using Google's JavaScript client
- Credentials stored in browser's local storage

## Usage

### At the Gym
1. Open the app on your phone
2. Select your routine (e.g., "Push Day")
3. Log each set: weight → reps → ✓
4. Rest timer starts automatically
5. Add notes about form, fatigue, etc.

### On Desktop
1. Plan routines by editing your Google Sheet
2. Review workout history and progress
3. Create charts and analyze trends

## Customization

### Add More Routines
Edit the "Routines" sheet in Google Sheets:
```
Push Day  | Bench Press    | Focus on form | 4
Push Day  | Overhead Press | Keep tight    | 3
Pull Day  | Pull-ups       | Slow negative | 4
```

### Change Rest Timer
Settings → Default Rest Time → Set your preference

## Roadmap
